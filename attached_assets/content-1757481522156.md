## A small selection of my work.

### WorkOS

WorkOS provides APIs and SDKs to make apps enterprise-ready. I built their Figma designs into a scalable and robust marketing site full of dedication to detail and engaging animations.

#### Some of my favorite details

#### MFA micro-interaction

We created a hero animation for every product page; this is my favorite one. Every 20 seconds a new random code is generated that you can verify – the same as using the real product.


#### Pricing calculator

The pricing calculator allows users to turn on and off different products, estimating the price playfully. The WorkOS team can easily adjust numbers.


#### Code snippets

The code snippets use custom syntax highlighting and tooltips. The selected language is saved and synced across all pages.


#### Accessibility

Most developers prefer to use the keyboard rather than the mouse/trackpad, so the top navigation needed to be accessible.

## Starlight

New website for the financial OS for web3 teams with attention to detail down to the last pixel.

[Open live site](https://www.starlight.money/)

#### A few highlights

#### Laser shooting animation

The hero features a beautiful laser shooting animation. This is done using a custom CSS animation triggered by a randomized JavaScript interval.


#### CMS-driven changelog

The changelog has an animated timeline and is fully CMS-driven for easy management. The entries can be filtered and use custom color themes based on category.


#### Attention to every detail

Every detail throughout the site is treated with care. For example, right-clicking the logo opens a custom context menu to download brand assets, and the status indicator shows the product's status in real time.

## Perspective

Powerful marketing site with multi-language support, a CMS landing page system, and tasteful interactions.

[Open live site](https://www.perspective.co/)

#### Tasteful interactions

The website is enhanced with tasteful, minimal interactions throughout all pages, resulting in an engaging experience that doesn't get in the user's way.


#### Video tabs

Each component has been built with care, especially these video tabs. There's a lot more complexity than visible, like syncing the tab indicator with the video length, play/pause, etc.


#### CMS landing pages

We implemented a CMS structure to easily create landing pages for different use cases, competitor comparisons, and sales pages. Everything can be managed by the Perspective team themselves.

## Compound Manual

Library of wealth planning resources for tech people. Built with a custom CMS architecture and delightful animations.

[Open live site](https://manual.withcompound.com/)

#### My favorite details

#### The bookshelf

My favorite part of the whole site is the bookshelf. The books have beautiful cover artwork and feature a 3d animation on hover. The slider is custom-built, and you can both scroll/drag or click to navigate it.


#### Dark mode

The dark mode is applied site-wide and also reacts to the system settings. It's essential that users can choose their favorite theme for reading.


#### The sidebar

For navigating between articles, we built this sidebar. Its content is fetched from the parent book of the current page, which is saved using query parameters. This enables using an easy Webflow CMS setup for the Compound team while tying together the strings with lots of custom code under the hood.

### Working at the intersection of design and code.

With years of experience in web design, I live and breathe good design and value the details that matter. Say goodbye to the stressful back and forth with developers who don’t have an eye for design and rely on someone who has the skills, experience, and enthusiasm to bring your visions to life the way they were intended.

#### Stunning animations.

From subtle micro-interactions to complex "WOW" animations. I transform ideas into delightful experiences.

### Clean, efficient code.

![Code snippet showing some HTML code](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6279077bf697b924fac6e205/633ebcc11a2e1b8730d51fb2_code-snippet.png)

### Fast turnaround times.

Months

Weeks

### Responsive development.

Should be standard nowadays, yet often not treated with care.

### Lightning-fast loading times.

All my builds put extra emphasis on performance and efficiency.

## My workflow to make the web flow.

1

### Project Request

The first step in our collaboration is the project request. This gives me an idea of what you're looking for and helps me determine if I'm the right fit for your project. If so, we will schedule a video call to dive deeper.

2

### First Meeting

Trust is extremely important to me when working together. In our initial meeting, we get to know each other and see if we are a good fit. We also talk about your goals & requirements, clarify questions and define the next steps.

3

### Proposal

After I have learned as much as possible about your project, I will create an individual proposal. I don't charge for my work by the hour but on a per-project basis. This way, you'll have a complete overview of the costs upfront.

### Implementation

Once I have everything needed, I'm ready to start with the implementation. Ensuring transparent communication and regular updates is a priority for me. I'll keep you in the loop using convenient communication channels like Slack.

### Launch

Before launching, the finalized website will go through quality assurance to ensure every detail is just right. Depending on the project, I'll help to launch with Webflow's ultra-fast hosting or via code export.
